# ansible-inventory-yml
Alternative YAML formatted inventory for Ansible. This allows you to to assign groups to hosts as well as hosts to groups, and easily make new groups that are supersets and subsets of other groups.

*NOTE:* Ansible supports it's own YML formatted inventory, see: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/hosts.yaml

# Usage

Copy `hosts.py` and `hosts.sh` into the directory you are using ansible from.  In `ansible.cfg`, set `inventory` to `hosts.sh`.

```
[defaults]
inventory = hosts.sh
```

You can control the name of the `hosts.yml` file by setting `ANSIBLE_HOSTS_YML`.

# Format of `hosts.yml`

The YAML file is divided into two sections, `groups` and `hosts`.

## Hosts (optional)
Each host in the `hosts` section can have `groups` to define it's group membership, and `vars` to define host variables.

```yaml
hosts:
  web-app1-prod.location1.com:
    groups:
      - app1
      - location1
      - prod
      - web

  db-app1-prod.location1.com:
    groups:
      - app1
      - location1
      - prod
      - db

  app1-dev.location1.com:
    vars:
      EXAMPLE: "true"
    groups:
      - app1
      - location2
      - dev
      - web
      - dev
```

## Groups (optional)

Entries in `groups` are optional, but they allow the creation groups by listing it's `hosts`, `children`, and/or `vars` as in the standard Ansible inventory file.  You can also use `include` to include all hosts from another group, and `require` to remove hosts that are not part of the other group, for instance all production web servers.  This is useful when combined with `group_vars` files.

``` yaml
groups:
  app1-location1-prod:
    include:
      - app1
    require:
      - prod

  app2-prod:
    hosts:
      - app2-web1

  app2:
    children:
      - app2-prod
      - app2-dev

  all-apps:
    children:
      - app1
      - app2
```
